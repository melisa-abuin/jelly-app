### Installation

Jelly Music App is available as a production build, ready to deploy on an existing web server. Download the latest release from our project's [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Stannnnn/jelly-app/releases) and place the contents of the archived folder in a web-accessible directory.
<br/>
It's also available as a **docker image** for easy deployment, see docker details below.
<br/>
<br/>

[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) (`npm i -g yarn`) is required if you wish to build the project or run the development server yourself.

#### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stannnnn/jelly-app.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
3. Build the production files:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
4. Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to a web-accessible directory.

Alternatively, you can run the development server directly: `yarn dev` or `yarn dev:nocache`

If you wish to use a base path for the application other than root (`/`), you must build it manually while setting `URL_BASE_PATH` to your preferred base path.

Leave the configuration as the default, or change [`config.json`](public/config.json) as needed. Configurations are explained on the [App Configuration Section](#app-configuration).
The `config.json` file can be changed directly in the built application afterwards. There is no need to rebuild if only changing a configuration variable.

### Docker

You can easily host Jelly Music App using Docker with the prebuilt image from ghcr.io:

#### Pull the docker image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/stannnnn/jelly-music-app:latest
```

#### Run the docker image

```bash
docker run --rm -p 80:80 ghcr.io/stannnnn/jelly-music-app:latest
```

Docker image can also be run in the background by adding the -d flag `docker run -d ...`

#### Run the docker image with configuration variables

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -e DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL=https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable \
    -e LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL=false \
    -p 80:80 ghcr.io/stannnnn/jelly-music-app:latest
```

<br/>

The following are the available tags for docker:

| Tag    | Description                |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| latest | Tracks most recent release |
| main   | Tracks the main branch     |
| vX.X.X | Version specific tags      |

E.g: `ghcr.io/stannnnn/jelly-music-app:latest`

#### Docker Container Build

You can also build Jelly Music App using Docker.

1.  Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build . --tag jelly-music-app
    ```

2.  Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 80:80 jelly-music-app:latest
    ```

    You can also provide configuration using environment variables.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
        -e DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL=https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable \
        -e LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL=false \
        -p 80:80 jelly-music-app:latest
    ```

### App Configuration

App configuration can be modified by editing the `config.json` file during the build process or in the release files. When using Docker, configurations can be provided as environment variables. The available configuration options are as follows:

-   `DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL`: Sets the default Jellyfin server URL loaded on first app access if no URL is stored in Local Storage.
-   `LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL`: If set to `true`, removes the URL input field and enforces the default URL (`DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL`) for all connections, ideal for self-hosted instances tied to a single server.
